# AI Development Instructions

## Before starting work
- Read this file.
- Read AI_HANDOFF.md.
- Inspect git status and recent commits.
- Review relevant existing code before modifying it.
- Do not redo completed work unless necessary.

## Development rules
- Keep changes focused.
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly changing it.
- Follow the existing project architecture and coding conventions.
- Consider security implications of all changes.
- Never commit credentials, API keys, private keys, or production secrets.
- Run relevant tests after changes.

## Handoff rules
Before handing development to another AI:
- Update AI_HANDOFF.md.
- Update patch.md as the current patch/version-control ledger.
- Record what was completed.
- Record what remains unfinished.
- Record important technical decisions.
- Record known bugs or failed approaches.
- Record relevant test/build results.
- Identify the recommended next step.

`patch.md` must be updated for every source/schema/UI/test/build change. It must
include intended files, excluded local artifacts, validation evidence, known
limitations, security decisions, and the exact next slice.

## Git
- Prefer small meaningful commits.
- Do not overwrite unrelated changes.
- Do not force-push unless explicitly instructed.
